    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>AuraBot is a free tool built on Discord to help people with ADHD and/or anxiety. It allows users to track their moods, keep an eye on habits, and see their progress over time. By using Discord, we make it easy to use and completely free. More people can access it without needing to pay for a therapist.</p>
      <p>Many mood-tracking tools are either too expensive or not easy for everyone to use. AuraBot is different because it's simple and keeps personal data safe. Our goal is to give people an easy and supportive way to take care of their mental health.</p>

    <!-- Positive Disability Principles -->
    <section>
      <h2>Positive Disability Principles</h2>
      <p>We applied Positive Disability Principles by avoiding ableist assumptions, centering user agency, and designing for inclusivity. Features such as customizable prompts and streak-based motivation empower users to track emotional well-being on their own terms.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-ableist language:</strong> Avoided stigmatizing terms and ensured descriptions were inclusive.</li>
        <li><strong>User control:</strong> Allowing users to delete entries and customize reminders.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-disability solidarity:</strong> Considering diverse needs, including ADHD and anxiety.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Related Work -->
    <section>
      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>Existing mood-tracking apps like Daylio and Reflectly inspired our work. However, these tools often lack accessibility features, such as compatibility with screen readers or options for private logging on platforms like Discord. AuraBot addresses these gaps by integrating assistive technology support and prioritizing user privacy.</p>

    <!-- Methodology and Results -->
    <section>
      <h2>Methodology and Results</h2>
      <p>We developed AuraBot using Python and the Discord API, with MongoDB for secure data storage. The bot includes features like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Private mood logging via Discord commands.</li>
        <li>Customizable daily check-ins and reminders.</li>
        <li>Data visualization for mood trends.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our metrics for success included screen-reader compatibility, secure data encryption, and positive user feedback during testing.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Disability Justice Analysis</h2>
      <p>This project aligns with principles of disability justice, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intersectionality:</strong> Considering overlapping identities, such as ADHD and anxiety, in design decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Anti-capitalism:</strong> Providing a free tool without monetization pressures.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-disability solidarity:</strong> Designing for multiple disabilities, including visual and cognitive impairments.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Learnings and Future Work -->
    <section>
      <h2>Learnings and Future Work</h2>
      <p>We learned the importance of prioritizing accessibility from the start. Future iterations could include multilingual support, more advanced data visualizations, and expanded integrations with other platforms.</p>
