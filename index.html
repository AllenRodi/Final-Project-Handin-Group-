      <h2>Introduction: What is AuraBot?</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is important, but finding tools to manage it can be a challenge. 
        For people with <strong>ADHD</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>, tracking moods and building healthy habits is often overwhelming. 
        Many existing tools are <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>hard to use</strong>, or don’t respect user privacy, leaving people without the support they need. 
        That’s why we created <strong>AuraBot</strong>—a free and simple tool on Discord that helps users 
        <strong>track their moods</strong>, <strong>monitor habits</strong>, and <strong>see progress over time</strong>. 
        By using Discord, a platform millions already rely on, AuraBot makes mental health tracking easy to access without the need for additional apps or costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        AuraBot focuses on <strong>privacy, simplicity, </strong> and <strong>inclusivity.</strong> 
        It only collects necessary data and keeps it secure, so users feel safe. 
        The bot is designed to be easy to use, with <strong>clear commands</strong> and <strong>customizable reminders</strong> 
        that help users track habits like drinking water or logging emotions. 
        While it’s especially useful for those with ADHD or anxiety, AuraBot is also designed for anyone who wants to 
        <strong>build healthier habits</strong> or <strong>better understand their emotions</strong>. 
        With features like <strong>mood trend visualization</strong>, AuraBot gives users helpful insights to improve their well-being. 
        Our goal is to provide a <strong>supportive, accessible tool</strong> that empowers everyone to take control of their mental health.

      <p>AuraBot helps users track their mood and visualize trends to improve mental well-being. Below are visualizations of key features:</p>
      
      <h3>Showing /menu and /viewgoal</h3>
      <img src="images/menu.png" alt="Screenshot of a Discord chat showing AuraBot's available commands after using the /menu command. The bot lists commands such as /menu to display the menu, /createprofile to create a user profile, /viewprofile to view a profile, /habittracking to list habit tracking commands, /moodlogging to list mood logging commands, and /goaltracking to list goal tracking commands.">
      
      <h3>Reminder Notifications</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>We understand the challenges of ADHD and anxiety, so we created AuraBot to help users organize feelings, habits, and reminders in a supportive and accessible way.</li>
            <li>We prioritized features like customizable reminders and private mood tracking based on our understanding of what works best for users.</li>
            <li>By centering our experiences, we created a tool that empowers others through meaningful and relatable features.</li>

        <li><strong>Intersectionality:</strong>
          <ul>
