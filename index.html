      <h2>Introduction: What is AuraBot?</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is important, but finding tools to manage it can be a challenge.
        For people with <strong>ADHD</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>, tracking moods and building healthy habits
        can be a lot to think about. 
        Many existing tools are <strong>expensive</strong>. Some are <strong>hard to use</strong>, and some don’t respect user privacy. This
        leaves many people without mental health support.
        Our project is <strong>AuraBot</strong>. AuraBot is a free and simple tool on Discord. It helps users
        <strong>track their moods</strong>, <strong>monitor habits</strong>, and <strong>see progress over
          time</strong>.
        By using Discord, a platform millions of people have, AuraBot makes mental health tracking easy to access. Users will no longer 
        need for other apps or pay extra costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        AuraBot focuses on <strong>privacy, simplicity, </strong> and <strong>inclusivity.</strong>
        It only collects necessary data and keeps it secure, so users feel safe.
        The bot is designed to be easy to use, with <strong>clear commands</strong> and <strong>customizable
          reminders</strong>.
        This helps users track habits like drinking water or logging emotions.
        While it’s especially useful for those with ADHD or anxiety, AuraBot is also for anyone who wants to
        <strong>build healthier habits</strong>. Or for those who want to <strong>better understand their emotions</strong>.
        With features like <strong>mood trend displays</strong>, AuraBot gives users helpful details to improve
        their well-being.
        Our goal is to provide a <strong>supportive, accessible tool</strong> that empowers everyone to take control of
        their mental health.

    <!-- Methodology and Results -->
    <section>
      <h2>Methodology and Results</h2>
      <h3><strong>What did you do?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        As a team, we developed AuraBot, a Discord-based mood logging and habit tracker designed for individuals navigating ADHD
        and/or anxiety.
        With accessibility as the key focus, AuraBot helps users manage daily routines and support emotional regulation through
        its specialized features.
        ADHD can involve limitations with focus, time management, and remembering tasks, while anxiety may bring about
        overwhelming stress.
        These experiences highlight the importance of tools that simplify routine management and encourage self-awareness.
        AuraBot seeks to fill this gap by offering a free, accessible tool that tracks moods, supports habit formation,
        and promotes goal visualization.
        Built-in features like customizable reminders and progress tracking help users to manage their emotional well-being in
        a structured, yet flexible way, whether it be used publicly or privately.
        By integrating these features into Discord, AuraBot uses a familiar platform to provide support without the
        need for downloading additional apps or subscriptions.
        Ultimately, AuraBot aims to build emotional awareness and proactive mental health management in an inclusive
        and supportive environment.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Project Design and Development Process</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Our team developed AuraBot using Python and the Discord API, focusing on features designed to meet the needs of our
        target audience.
        Key functionalities include mood logging, habit tracking, and goal setting, allowing users to document emotions,
        stressors, sleep duration, and medication
        intake through simple commands.
        To promote user agency AuraBot enables customizable entries for these functions, empowering users to
        tailor the tool to their unique needs and preferences.
        We used MongoDB for encrypted data storage, ensuring privacy and security.
        Development was a collaborative effort, with each team member contributing by implementing and testing specific
        features.
        Tools like VS Code and GitHub supported efficient development and seamless version control, ensuring high-quality
        outcomes.
        These efforts enabled us to implement custom reminders, track progress, and develop visual reporting features that
        summarize users' mood and habit trends over time.
        Together, these elements form a cohesive system that is both functional and user-centered. 
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Key Features and Accessibility Enhancements</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility was central to AuraBot's design, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of its users. Although intended for
        those with ADHD and/or anxiety,
        features such as screen-reader compatibility make the bot inclusive for users varying levels of vision.
        Customizable reminders allow users to set personalized notifications for tasks, medication, routines, or goals, reducing
        cognitive load and supporting consistency.
        The visual reporting tools enable users to identify patterns and trends in their mood, habits, and goal progress,
        helping them gain valuable insights into their emotional well-being.
        To foster engagement, AuraBot includes a reward system that provides positive reinforcement for consistent use,
        encouraging users to maintain healthy routines and achieve their goals.
        These features not only promote personal growth but also create a supportive and user-friendly experience.
        </p>

      <h3><strong>Challenges and Problem-Solving Approach</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The development of AuraBot presented several challenges, particularly in implementing secure data storage, designing an
        intuitive user interface, and incorporating effective goal-tracking features.
        To address these issues, we focused on reducing cognitive load and ensuring ease of use.
        Multiple testing cycles were conducted to refine the bot's functionality and gather feedback from the team acting as
        users, ensuring it met
        the specific needs of individuals with ADHD and anxiety while supporting goal setting and tracking.
        Collaboration was a key factor in overcoming these challenges, with team members using GitHub to identify and resolve
        bugs efficiently.
        One significant hurdle was managing the bot's functionality during development, as we encountered issues with having
        only one terminal working at a time. If multiple team developers tried to interact with the bot simultaneously, it would crash,
        complicating both testing and debugging processes.
        Clear task division allowed us to maintain steady progress and ensure each feature was fully
        developed and tested.
        This iterative approach not only improved AuraBot's technical performance but also strengthened its usability.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Learning Outcomes and Technical Growth</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Developing AuraBot provided our team with valuable technical and collaborative experience.
        We gained proficiency in tools like the Discord API, MongoDB, and GitHub, enhancing our ability to build secure,
        scalable applications.
        The project deepened our understanding of accessibility principles, particularly those aligned with disability
        justice, such as centering the leadership of those most impacted.
        Collaboration was another significant area of growth, as we learned to balance individual contributions with
        collective goals while addressing technical limitations.
        These experiences have not only strengthened our technical skills but also gave us the tools to create
        meaningful and impactful projects in the future.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Results and Impact</strong></h3>
      <p>
        AuraBot provides a structured, engaging platform for logging moods, tracking habits, and receiving personalized
        reminders.
        Feedback from initial testing has been mixed, but mostly positive, with users highlighting the reward system being
        particularly
        impactful as shown below.
        These tools empower users to engage consistently and make meaningful progress toward their goals.
        AuraBot's success demonstrates how thoughtful design and accessible technology can promote emotional awareness and
        well-being.
        As we continue to refine and expand its features, AuraBot will remain a valuable resource for individuals navigating
        ADHD and anxiety, empowering them to manage their routines, build self-awareness, and achieve their goals in a
        supportive environment.
