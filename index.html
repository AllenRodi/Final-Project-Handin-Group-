      <h2>Introduction: What is AuraBot?</h2>
      <p>
        Mental health is important, but finding tools to manage it can be a challenge.
        For people with <strong>ADHD</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>, tracking moods and building healthy habits
        is often overwhelming.
        Many existing tools are <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>hard to use</strong>, or don’t respect user privacy,
        leaving people without the support they need.
        That’s why we created <strong>AuraBot</strong>—a free and simple tool on Discord that helps users
        <strong>track their moods</strong>, <strong>monitor habits</strong>, and <strong>see progress over
          time</strong>.
        By using Discord, a platform millions already rely on, AuraBot makes mental health tracking easy to access
        without the need for additional apps or costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        AuraBot focuses on <strong>privacy, simplicity, </strong> and <strong>inclusivity.</strong>
        It only collects necessary data and keeps it secure, so users feel safe.
        The bot is designed to be easy to use, with <strong>clear commands</strong> and <strong>customizable
          reminders</strong>
        that help users track habits like drinking water or logging emotions.
        While it’s especially useful for those with ADHD or anxiety, AuraBot is also designed for anyone who wants to
        <strong>build healthier habits</strong> or <strong>better understand their emotions</strong>.
        With features like <strong>mood trend visualization</strong>, AuraBot gives users helpful insights to improve
        their well-being.
        Our goal is to provide a <strong>supportive, accessible tool</strong> that empowers everyone to take control of
        their mental health.

    <!-- Methodology and Results -->
    <section>
      <h2>Methodology and Results</h2>
      <h3><strong>Introduction and Purpose</strong></h3>
      <p>
        AuraBot was designed to address the unique challenges faced by individuals with ADHD and anxiety, conditions
        that significantly impact daily routines and emotional regulation.
        ADHD often presents difficulties with maintaining focus, managing time effectively, and remembering tasks, while
        anxiety can lead to overwhelming stress and struggles with decision-making.
        These challenges highlight the importance of tools that simplify routine management and encourage
        self-awareness.
        AuraBot seeks to fill this gap by offering a free, accessible tool that tracks moods, supports habit formation,
        and promotes goal visualization.
        Features like customizable reminders and progress tracking empower users to manage their emotional well-being in
        a structured yet flexible way.
        By integrating these features into Discord, AuraBot leverages a familiar platform to provide support without the
        need for additional apps or subscriptions.
        Ultimately, AuraBot aims to foster emotional awareness and proactive mental health management in an inclusive
        and supportive environment.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Project Design and Development Process</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Our team developed AuraBot using <strong>Python</strong> and the <strong>Discord API</strong>, focusing on
        features that align with the needs of our target audience.
        Key functionalities include mood logging, where users can document emotions, stressors, sleep duration, and
        medication intake through simple commands.
        We used <strong>MongoDB</strong> for secure and encrypted data storage, ensuring both privacy and accessibility.
        Development was a collaborative effort, with each team member responsible for implementing and testing specific
        features.
        Tools like <strong>VS Code</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong> facilitated efficient development and seamless
        version control, ensuring high-quality results.
        These efforts allowed us to implement custom reminders, track progress, and create visual reporting tools that
        summarize users’ mood and habit trends over time.
        Together, these elements form a cohesive system that is both functional and user-friendly.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Key Features and Accessibility Enhancements</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Accessibility was central to AuraBot’s design, ensuring that it could meet the diverse needs of its users.
        Features such as <strong>screen-reader compatibility</strong> and <strong>text-to-speech support</strong> make
        the bot inclusive for individuals with visual impairments or cognitive challenges.
        Customizable reminders allow users to set personalized notifications for tasks, medication, or routines,
        reducing cognitive load and supporting consistency.
        The visual reporting tools enable users to identify patterns and trends in their mood and habits, helping them
        gain valuable insights into their emotional well-being.
        To foster engagement, AuraBot includes a reward system that provides positive reinforcement for consistent use,
        encouraging users to maintain healthy routines.
        These features not only promote personal growth but also create a supportive and user-friendly experience.
        AuraBot is a testament to how accessibility and thoughtful design can intersect to address real-world
        challenges.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Challenges and Problem-Solving Approach</strong></h3>
      <p>
        The development of AuraBot presented several challenges, particularly in implementing secure data storage and
        designing an intuitive user interface.
        To address these issues, we adhered to user-centered design principles, focusing on reducing cognitive load and
        ensuring ease of use.
        Multiple testing cycles were conducted to refine the bot’s functionality and gather feedback from users,
        ensuring it met the specific needs of individuals with ADHD and anxiety.
        Collaboration was a key factor in overcoming these challenges, with team members using GitHub to identify and
        resolve bugs efficiently.
        Clear task division allowed us to maintain steady progress and ensure each feature was fully developed and
        tested.
        This iterative approach not only improved AuraBot’s technical performance but also strengthened its usability.
        By addressing challenges methodically, we created a tool that is both reliable and accessible.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Learning Outcomes and Technical Growth</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Developing AuraBot provided our team with valuable technical and collaborative experience.
        We gained proficiency in tools like the Discord API, MongoDB, and GitHub, enhancing our ability to build secure,
        scalable applications.
        The project deepened our understanding of accessibility principles, particularly those aligned with disability
        justice, such as centering the leadership of those most impacted.
        This user-centered design approach taught us how to prioritize inclusivity while maintaining functionality,
        ensuring that the bot meets diverse user needs.
        Collaboration was another significant area of growth, as we learned to balance individual contributions with
        collective goals.
        These experiences have not only strengthened our technical skills but also equipped us with the tools to create
        meaningful and impactful projects in the future.
        AuraBot’s development process highlights the importance of combining technical innovation with empathy and
        user-focused design.
      </p>

      <h3><strong>Results and Impact</strong></h3>
      <p>
        AuraBot provides a structured, engaging platform for logging moods, tracking habits, and receiving personalized
        reminders.
        By integrating seamlessly into Discord, the bot offers a unique blend of personal tracking and community
        support, making it accessible and approachable for all users.
        Feedback from initial testing has been overwhelmingly positive, with users highlighting features like mood
        visualization and the reward system as particularly impactful.
        These tools empower users to engage consistently and make meaningful progress toward their goals.
        AuraBot’s success demonstrates how thoughtful design and accessible technology can promote emotional awareness
        and well-being.
        As we continue to refine and expand its features, AuraBot will remain a valuable resource for individuals with
        ADHD, anxiety, and beyond.
        By prioritizing inclusivity, privacy, and usability, AuraBot has set a strong foundation for future growth and
        impact.
